ðŸ‘‹ Web Application Pentester - Intro
-----
A web app penetration tester is a specific type of penetration tester who focuses on internet-facing web applications. Many of these apps handle personally identifiable information (PII) like credit card data or health records. Itâ€™s in a companyâ€™s best interest to hire a web app penetration tester to perform pen testing and vulnerability assessments that meet regulatory compliance.

In general, the role of penetration tester is not an entry-level job â€“ you must gain IT and cybersecurity experience first. This is especially true for a web app penetration tester. Employers will expect candidates to understand how to identify scripts in various software deployments and explain how they used various tools during the phases of a penetration test.

Web application penetration testing is the practice of simulating attacks on a system in an attempt to gain access to sensitive data, with the purpose of determining whether a system is secure. These attacks are performed either internally or externally on a system, and they help provide information about the target system, identify vulnerabilities within them, and uncover exploits that could actually compromise the system. It is an essential health check of a system that informs testers whether remediation and security measures are needed.
